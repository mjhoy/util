libmjh -- common C stuff

  Taken/copied liberally from Michael Kerrisk, *The Linux Programming
  Interface*. Provides various error functions, number parsing, other
  common things.


USING

  This is sort of testing out how to package up a c lib using nix. In
  your config.nix,

    libmjh = import ~/path/to/libmjh { inherit stdenv; };

  In other C projects that use it; e.g.,

    #include "mjh_common.h"

    int foo() {
      int fd;
      fd = open("/tmp/foo");
      if (fd == -1)
        errExit("open");
      close(fd);
      return 0;
    }

  a default.nix might have something like:

    buildInputs = [ libmjh ];
    inherit libmjh;

  The `buildInputs' line sets the include path for the headers, and
  the `inherit libmjh' sets an environment variable $libmjh that
  points to the installed path, in which lib/libmjh.a is the actual
  library.
  
  So, with a build (Makefile), run something like

    gcc -o foo my.c files.c ${libmjh}/lib/libmjh.a
